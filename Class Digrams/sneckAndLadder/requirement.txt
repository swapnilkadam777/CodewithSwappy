Design a class diagram for the traditional game of Snake and Ladder with the following requirements:

Board: A standard Snake and Ladder board contains 100 cells numbered from 1 to 100.
Players: The game can be played by 2-4 players.
Dice: The game will have a standard dice that can roll numbers between 1 to 6.
Snakes: Snakes will have a start point (mouth) and an endpoint (tail). If a player lands on the mouth, they are taken down to the tail.
Ladders: Ladders will have a start point (bottom) and an endpoint (top). If a player lands on the bottom, they climb up to the top.
Turns: Players take turns in a round-robin fashion to roll the dice and move.
Winning Condition: A player wins if they land on the 100th cell exactly. For example, if a player is on the 99th cell, they must roll a 1 to win.
